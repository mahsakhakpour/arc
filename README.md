# ARC – Rainbow Arc Generator

A small experimental project exploring graphics with PHP.  
This project demonstrates how simple code can create colorful and dynamic graphics using the PHP GD library.

## How it works

- The project uses **PHP** and the **GD library** to generate rainbow arcs programmatically.  
- The main script (`rainbow.php`) creates a 400x400 canvas and draws layered arcs with different colors.  

## Usage

To see the rainbow arc in action:

1. Clone the repository or download the `rainbow.php` file.  
2. Run it on a PHP environment with GD library enabled:

```bash
php rainbow.php > rainbow.jpg
